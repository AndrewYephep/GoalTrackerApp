This Project is focusing on honing in the abilities of this application, I do not want major changes and the changes supplied need to follow the patterns already in the code. For any changes, do not make any changes that are not clearly implied or directly stated, if it is not mentioned it should not be done. If something needs to be done that I have not stated, mention it to me and I will respond with my decision. Follow my directions and always think of things that need to be done to make the implementation you are adding work the first time. Give me a rundown of what else I should do relating to the update we are working on after providing the updated code.
